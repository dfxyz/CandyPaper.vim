CandyPaper - A Dark Theme for Vim
================================================================================

CandyPaper is a dark color scheme for **Vim** and **GVim** inspired by
[PaperColor (Dark Version)](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) and 
[CandyCode](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1635).

I tried to make this scheme as simple as possible and didn't plan to support extra syntax plugins like PaperColor does.

Currently fine-tuned for **C/C++**, **Java**, **Python**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, 
**CSS**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **XML**, **Markdown** and **VimL**.

Removed all bold and italic effects (maybe)
because CJK characters don't render well in these shapes.

## Installation
Just put 'CandyPaper.vim' into the 'colors' directory. 
Or use a plugin manager like [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

Then, add this into your `~/.vimrc`:

```VimL
    set t_Co=256
    colorscheme CandyPaper
```
